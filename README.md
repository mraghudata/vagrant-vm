# vagrant-vm

For all my open source project, I am using vagrant, which shares the common .m2, and Projects path.

The changes can be made by IntelliJ, and build executed in the vagrant box.

Once have proper vagrant box running, we can create snapshot, in case of crash or further changes which mess up, we can load the snapshot.
